# Intelligent Battery Recharge Management for Mobile Robots

This repository contains the codebases of the projects done during the PhD tenure of Dr. Tanmoy Kundu. The work is done under the supervision of Prof. Indranil Saha, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. During Ph.D, Tanmoy's research topic was "Intelligent Battery Recharge Management for Mobile Robots". 

In recent times, mobile robots are being used in manifold applications. As these robots are generally battery-powered, they need to recharge their batteries at regular intervals. In his thesis, novel algorithms are designed to plan optimized path, task and recharge plans for the robots, with static and mobile rechargers. NP-hardness (computational intractability) of these optimization problems are proved in his work. To address such intractable problems, he leverages techniques like reducing the problem to Constraint Solving Problems which are then solved using suitable constraint solvers, or design Approximation Algorithms, to find near-optimal plans for different variants of the problems. These techniques show performance gain in terms of scalability, and improve time complexity while not compromising quality of the solution much.
