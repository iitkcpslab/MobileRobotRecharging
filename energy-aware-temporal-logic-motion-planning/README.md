This paper presents a methodology for synthesizing a motion plan for a mobile robot to ensure that the robot
never gets depleted with battery charge while carrying out its
mission successfully. The specification of the robot is provided
in the form of an LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula. A
trajectory satisfying an LTL formula may contain a loop whose
repetitive execution causes the depletion of battery charge in the
robot. The motion plan generated by our methodology ensures
that the robot visits the charging station periodically in such
a way that it never gets depleted with battery charge while
carrying out its mission optimally. Given a set of potential
charging station locations and an LTL specification, our algorithm also finds the best location for the charging station
along with the optimal trajectory for the robot. We encode
the motion planning problem as an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo
Theory) solving problem and use the off-the-shelf SMT solver
Z3 to solve the constraints to find the location of the charging
station and generate an optimal trajectory for the robot. We
apply our methodology to synthesize energy-aware trajectories
for robots with different dynamics in various workspaces and
for various LTL specifications.

LTLPlan does energy-aware path planning for Turtlebot and Quadcopter motion primitives, and LTLPlan\_v2 does the planning for Dubins vehicle.

PREREQUISITES:

<maximum cost>


2. obstacle.txt contains obstacle grid positions (2-D)


3. 2d_template.txt contains motion primitive details
<primitive id>
<initial velocity>
<final velocity>
<displacement of [x, y] distance from current position>
<cost of applying this primitive>
<time required to apply this primitive>
<swath locations from the current location, while applied>

4. input contains the LTL formula 

Similarly, details of other primitives are captured.
