# Approximation Algorithms for Charging Station Placement for Mobile Robots

This project designs approximation algorithms for finding charging station placement with complex robot primitives and complex workspace designs.

findd\_domset\_approx contains approximation algorithms to find the near-optimal value of the battery threshold (d) for a given value of number of charging stations (ncs). This algorithm is based on the known approximation algorithm for finding the dominating set in a graph.

findncs\_sc\_approx contains the approximation algorithms to find the near-optimal value of the number of charging stations (ncs) for a given battery threshold (d). This algorithm is based on the known approximation algorithm for finding a set cover.
